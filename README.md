> Hi! I'm a software developer and tech lover for over 15 years. I've been creating tools, websites and also some romhacking projects for the speedrunning and retro community.

**ðŸ•¹ Speedrunning?**
> When you wanna play again the same game you loved but with a new objective, finish it as fast as possible. I've been doing [speedruns](https://speedrun.com/furious) since 2014, I mostly play Super Mario World, but I also enjoy other retro and newgen games.

**ðŸŒŸ Support**
> You can encourage me to keep doing what I love (development and speedrunning games), I'm always trying to bring something that is useful for everyone.
